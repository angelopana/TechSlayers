# Level Up

This is where you start! You will learn a little of everything with an emphasis on how to fix systems, set them 
up and secure them. This is where you get your foundation to start to your tech career or enrich your own tech 
skills and understanding! We recommend you start at ITF+ to get your feet wet and figure out the path you want 
to peruse. These courses are great for upper management leaders, High school graduates or professionals looking 
to understand the equipment they use daily.
